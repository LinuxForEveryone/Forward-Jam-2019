These miles are eating me alive,
Twisting my insides out
It’s daring me to survive but your words are fuel
And this wine is fire

People bloom and wither, running, fading away.
I try to keep up the pace but my mind aches for the day

When you hold me together while I’m 
Just screaming at nothing and 
I need you to brace me from this storm
That keeps on coming and
I curse at the road, 
I just keep willing myself closer
When my song disappears, do you keep singing it forever?     

Go on, keep singing me.
